<summary>Tools</summary>

- **`search_products`** — search by product name (Hebrew or English), or narrow by filters (brand, size, spec, price, …) to list the products in a category — one page, or every page in a single call. Returns names, prices, stock, and links.
- **`get_filters`** — see the filters available for a search or category (all screen sizes, brands, resolutions, features, …) and how many products match each, so a search can be narrowed precisely.
- **`get_product`** — full details for one product (by id or URL): price, any active promo/discount pricing, stock, and size/config options; optionally specs, images, branch availability, delivery options, and similar items — or the entire raw payload untouched.
- **`get_product_images`** — download all of a product's photos and get their local file paths, ready to open and view.

<summary>How it works</summary>

Talks directly to KSP's internal JSON API — the same one the website uses — so results are fast and structured, with no HTML scraping. Runs locally over stdio; no account, API key, or login required.

<summary>Requirements</summary>

- Node.js 20+

</details>

<details>
<summary>Local development</summary>

```bash
npm install   # auto-builds via prepare
npm run reload  # rebuild + restart the dev server
```

The `.mcp.json` at the project root registers a `ksp-dev` server pointing at `dist/index.js`.
